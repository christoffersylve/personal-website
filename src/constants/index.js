The collective goal of these projects was to develop an application capable of retrieving user data from Azure and visualizing it using React. Over the course of the summer, I successfully completed all the projects to such a high standard that the organization chose to integrate my work into their codebase. The data visualization tool I created continues to be utilized by their sales force, providing valuable insights into product usage to this day.`,
